## Introduction

`mogutda` contains Python codes that demonstrate the numerical calculation
of algebraic topology in an application to topological data analysis
(TDA). Its core code is the numerical methods concerning implicial complex,
and the estimation of homology and Betti numbers.

Topological data analysis aims at studying the shapes of the data, and
draw some insights from them. A lot of machine learning algorithms deal
with distances, which are extremely useful, but they miss the
information the data may carry from their geometry.

## History

The codes in this package were developed as a demonstration of a few posts of my blog.
It was not designed to be a Python package but a pedagogical collection of codes.
(See: [PyTDA](https://github.com/stephenhky/PyTDA).)
However, the codes and the blog posts have been unexpectedly popular. Therefore,
I modularized the code into the package [`mogu`](https://pypi.org/project/mogu/).
(or corresponding repository: [MoguNumerics](https://github.com/stephenhky/MoguNumerics))
However, `mogu` is simply a collection of unrelated numerical routines with a lot of
dependencies, but the part of TDA can be quite independent.

In order to provide other researchers and developers an independent package, which is compact (without
unecessary alternative packages to load), and efficient, I decided to modularize
the codes of TDA separately, and name this package `mogutda`.

## Prerequisite

It runs under Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

## Simple Tutorial: Simplicial Complex

You can install by:

```
pip install mogutda
```

To establish a simplicial complex for a torus, type

```
import numpy as np
from mogutda import SimplicialComplex

torus_sc = [(1,2,4), (4,2,5), (2,3,5), (3,5,6), (5,6,1), (1,6,2), (6,7,2), (7,3,2),
            (1,3,4), (3,4,6), (4,6,7), (4,5,7), (5,7,1), (7,3,1)]
torus_c = SimplicialComplex(simplices=torus_sc)
```

To retrieve its Betti numbers, type:

```
print(torus_c.betti_number(0))   # print 1
print(torus_c.betti_number(1))   # print 2
print(torus_c.betti_number(2))   # print 1
```
