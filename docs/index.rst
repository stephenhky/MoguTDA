Welcome to mogutda's documentation!
===================================

`mogutda` contains Python codes that demonstrate the numerical calculation
of algebraic topology in an application to topological data analysis
(TDA). Its core code is the numerical methods concerning implicial complex,
and the estimation of homology and Betti numbers.

Topological data analysis aims at studying the shapes of the data, and
draw some insights from them. A lot of machine learning algorithms deal
with distances, which are extremely useful, but they miss the
information the data may carry from their geometry.

`mogutda` runs in Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.
